to LangChain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Contents \\n\\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nModules\\nUse Cases\\nReference Docs\\nEcosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to LangChain#\\n\\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:\\n\\n\\nData-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nAgentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\n\\n\\nThe LangChain framework is designed around these principles.\\n\\n\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\n\\n\\nGetting Started#\\n\\nHow to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\n\\nQuickstart Guide\\n\\n\\nConcepts and terminology.\\n\\n\\nConcepts and terminology\\n\\n\\nTutorials created by community experts and presented on YouTube.\\n\\n\\nTutorials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\n\\nThese modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application.\\n\\nFor each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LangChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use.\\n\\nThe docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\n\\n\\nThe modules are (from least to most complex):\\n\\n\\nModels: Supported model types and integrations.\\nPrompts: Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.\\nMemory: Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.\\nIndexes: Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.\\nChains: Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).\\nAgents: An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.\\nCallbacks: Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases#\\n\\nBest practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases:\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\\nAgent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.\\nPersonal Assistants: One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).\\nCode Understanding: Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReference Docs#\\n\\nFull documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\n\\n\\nLangChain Installation\\nReference Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcosystem#\\n\\nLangChain integrates a lot of different LLMs, systems, and products.\\nFrom the other side, many systems and products depend on LangChain.\\nIt creates a vibrant and thriving ecosystem.\\n\\n\\nIntegrations: Guides for how other products can be used with LangChain.\\nDependents: List of repositories that use LangChain.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Resources#\\n\\nAdditional resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\n\\n\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGallery: A collection of great projects that use Langchain, compiled by the folks at Kyrolabs. Useful for finding inspiration and example implementations.\\nDeploying LLMs in Production: A collection of best practices and tutorials for deploying LLMs in production.\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nYouTube: A collection of the LangChain tutorials and videos.\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we’ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnext\\nQuickstart Guide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Contents\\n  \\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nModules\\nUse Cases\\nReference Docs\\nEcosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Harrison Chase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n      © Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Last updated on Jun 13, 2023.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/stable/', 'loc': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/stable/', 'lastmod': '2023-06-13T17:52:13.106683+00:00', 'changefreq': 'weekly', 'priority': '1'})"

to LangChain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Contents \\n\\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nModules\\nUse Cases\\nReference Docs\\nEcosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to LangChain#\\n\\nLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:\\n\\n\\nData-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nAgentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\n\\n\\nThe LangChain framework is designed around these principles.\\n\\n\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\n\\n\\nGetting Started#\\n\\nHow to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\n\\nQuickstart Guide\\n\\n\\nConcepts and terminology.\\n\\n\\nConcepts and terminology\\n\\n\\nTutorials created by community experts and presented on YouTube.\\n\\n\\nTutorials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\n\\nThese modules are the core abstractions which we view as the building blocks of any LLM-powered application.\\n\\nFor each module LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces. LangChain also provides external integrations and even end-to-end implementations for off-the-shelf use.\\n\\nThe docs for each module contain quickstart examples, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\n\\n\\nThe modules are (from least to most complex):\\n\\n\\nModels: Supported model types and integrations.\\nPrompts: Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.\\nMemory: Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.\\nIndexes: Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.\\nChains: Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).\\nAgents: An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.\\nCallbacks: Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases#\\n\\nBest practices and built-in implementations for common LangChain use cases:\\n\\n\\nAutonomous Agents: Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\\nAgent Simulations: Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.\\nPersonal Assistants: One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).\\nCode Understanding: Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReference Docs#\\n\\nFull documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\n\\n\\nLangChain Installation\\nReference Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEcosystem#\\n\\nLangChain integrates a lot of different LLMs, systems, and products.\\nFrom the other side, many systems and products depend on LangChain.\\nIt creates a vibrant and thriving ecosystem.\\n\\n\\nIntegrations: Guides for how other products can be used with LangChain.\\nDependents: List of repositories that use LangChain.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Resources#\\n\\nAdditional resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\n\\n\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGallery: A collection of great projects that use Langchain, compiled by the folks at Kyrolabs. Useful for finding inspiration and example implementations.\\nDeploying LLMs in Production: A collection of best practices and tutorials for deploying LLMs in production.\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nModel Laboratory: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nYouTube: A collection of the LangChain tutorials and videos.\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we’ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnext\\nQuickstart Guide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Contents\\n  \\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nModules\\nUse Cases\\nReference Docs\\nEcosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Harrison Chase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n      © Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Last updated on Jun 13, 2023.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/', 'loc': 'https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/', 'lastmod': '2023-06-13T17:52:58.538791+00:00', 'changefreq': 'daily', 'priority': '0.9'})"

I’m fluent in machine learning best practices for large scale distributed systems, robust model training, high-speed model inference and continuous testing and integration of improved models. My work experience is in applied ML for vision, and 3D scene understanding (SLAM) for autonomous robotics at Sarcos and NASA. During my Masters I’m specializing in large scale, distributed ML modeling for scientific applications, working as an AI consultant on a heterogeneous team of scientists to solve cross-discipline problems with AI.\\nMy favorite tools are first and foremost Python, often super-powered by libraries to speed it up like Cython, Dask and multi-processing. PyTorch, Tensorflow and sklearn are home to me. Recently, my paid research is distributed ML training using Pytorch Distributed (DDP) and Tensorflow Distributed (tf.distribute), and I’m very comfortable with 3rd party distributed ML libraries like Ray.io and Horovod. Finally, I often build complex data engineering pipelines in Luigi, Airflow, RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes. And much more!\\nLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

Argonne recently announced our win!\\nThis project perfectly embodied my goals for grad school:\\nSolve a thorny scientific problem with novel, creative, applications of ML.Enjoy a cross-functional team of scientists: experts in material science, polymers, math and computer science, where I was able to serve as the AI specialist.Work with super-compute hardware. ThetaGPU has 192 A6000 GPUs across 24 nodes. Each node has either 320GB or 640GB (!!) of GPU memory to train Very Large Models, and, crucially, the high-capacity networking InfiniBand (!!) to make that scale useful.\\n\\nI watched live when these compute nodes (DGX A100) were unveiled by Nvidia. I was delighted with the opportunity to train my models on these gorgeous machines.\\nMy wonderful heterogeneous team of scientists:\\n\\nAria Coraor – Molecular Engineering, de Pablo Group, PhD @ UChicago.Ruijie Zhu – Computer Science, MS @ Northwestern University.Seonghwan Kim – Material Science, PhD @ UIUC.Jiahui Yang – Material Science and Engineering, PhD @ Northwestern University (not pictured).Me, Kastan Day – Applied Machine Learning, MS @ UIUC.\\nProblem Overview\\nThe problem is to predict how molecules of plastic (polymers) structure themselves when left to settle into equilibrium. We used molecular structure to predict the “period” at which these layers repeat.\\nAI-predicted 3D time evolution of lamellae, credits to\\xa0Ge Sun,\\xa0Yifeng (Oliver) Tang\\xa0and\\xa0Yiheng Wu.\\nThis is well characterized for short chains of molecules but becomes more difficult as (1) molecules get longer and (2) as the number of types of molecules in the chain increases above 2. In this competition the polymers were always 64 sequences long and had 2 or 3 types of molecules.\\nOur input is a string representing the polymer chain: “AAABCCBBBCC” of length 64. There is also an “interaction parameter” which characterizes how strongly B-C molecules are repelled from each other, it is a floating-point number between 0 and 3.5.\\nOur output is a float number between 0 and 16, representing the length of the Lamellar period shown in these diagrams.\\n\\nThese visuals further lend intuition about the problem space. We’re working with polymers that are a “block” of “A molecules” for the first 32 positions, then they’re random for the remaining 32 positions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur solution\\nI loved trying to understand the polymer’s key properties from the domain-experts on our team. Then I attempted to translate these key ideas into a ML model that attends to the proper features. What’s the right model to use?\\nAt first, since this is a “structured data” problem (not using images or audio), I thought XGBoost would be the most successful model. My prior research on which algorithms win in the real world shows that XGBoost dominates all structured data problems, while deep learning is more successful against “unstructured” data. However, the data has long-range dependencies that are not well captured by decision trees.\\nNext, I tried using Transformers since Attention would capture long-range dependencies. These occur when the polymer molecule’s tail “wraps around” and interacts with other parts of the molecule. However, attention is overparameterized, we have little data in this challenge and the model did not converge during training.\\nFinally, I tried transforming the molecular since problem into an image problem and used a CNN. Delightfully, this creative solution ended up providing the best results.\\nCNNKernel MachineAuto-encoder\\nBut the CNN can’t capture long-range dependencies! Enter feature engineering, a crucial step for most real-world problems.\\nWe created a set of new inputs by feeding them through exponential kernels (to capture long-range dependencies) and cosine kernels offset by different amounts (to capture long-range dependencies that occur mid-polymer-sequence). These features introduce new non-linear features that allow the model to see a fuller picture.\\n\\nAdditionally, we used a standard Autoencoder to provide additional non-linear features to the model. After training the model, we simply run the model over all our input sequences and extract the latent space (red box below) for each input sequence, and directly use that (lower-dimensional) vector as input to our final model.\\n\\nFinally, our model is built by running a CNN on the input sequence, then feeding the other feature-engineered values into the fully connected layers. This allows the fully connected layers to equally evaluate the inputs from each form of feature engineering to finally produce a final regression prediction of the lamellar period.\\nKernel-Based Multi-channel PolyConvNet\\nResults\\nIdeally, we would see all blue points fall exactly on the 45˚ Y=X black line. That would mean that each predicted value is exactly the same as the ground truth (“actual”) value. \\n\\nExplainability\\nDeep learning is notoriously difficult to explain. In our early data exploration, I used XGBoost to product “feature importance” values for each element of our input. Discovering which elements of our data explain our predictions will help up design the right model for the task. Furthermore, it helps molecular scientists better understand these interactions, so they can develop new hypotheses to test.\\nI was surprised to find that position 24 of [0-31] total positions had the greatest explanatory power, even more than the interaction parameter. Furthermore, it was interesting that the ‘tail’ of the sequence was the 2nd most critical area.\\n\\nExplanatory power of the input data.The first value (from the left) is ‘magnitude/interaction’ param. Top 3: (’24’, 0.537), (‘mag’, 0.490) (’30’, 0.383).\\nAnother important finding was that greater blockiness means greater lamellar period. We observed this after a qualitative analysis of the principal components of the latent space of our ML model. \\nSo we can see our model is able to predict our finally output, a regression score of lamellar period and this is evident in the PCA of the model weights, “the hidden space activations,” shown below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompetitor’s solutions\\nI’d like to highlight another team’s work. They had an elegant solution of training a CNN model on each of the individual datasets then ensembling their predictions together via a weight value that was learned by the model. Model ensembles are common, but I like the idea that the weight parameter was learned, instead of human-determined.\\n\\nIf you enjoyed this post, read my other machine learning posts on kastanday.com\\n\\nShare this:TweetPocketEmailLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

This is the single best resource for finding trails using their info-rich map.\\nTires\\nTires are probably the best cheap(er) upgrade you can make to improve the capabilities of your bike. My advice only applies to Tubeless tires (TR for Tubeless Ready must be written on the sidewall).\\nI need very different front and rear tires. In the front you must maximize traction, in the rear you want more efficient rolling and large cornering lugs. The rear should also be a beefier casing if you’re someone who takes big hits or ride aggressive downhill. \\nFront: Maxxis Assegai 2.5″ 3C MaxxGrip DoubleDown casing — the heavy duty casing makes my tire hold a line much better, and gives me more stability at high speed. Also the DH casing is insanely reliable — no flats ever! If you don’t want the weight penalty (~1lb extra to go from EXO to DH casing), then just do DH casing in the rear, but it’s nice in the front too if you have the legs for it. \\nRear: Maxxis DHR 2.5 Maxxgrip DD Casing (or 2.4″ or 2.3″ for faster rolling speed). The DD casing is a perfect medium for fewer flats while still being on my trail bike. Heavier casings are even more important in the rear where big hits will brutalize your rear wheel. \\nTire inserts: I don’t think they’re worth the trouble. Increased maintenance is not worth it and I doubt the rim protection is all that good. I think I share a majority opinion here, especially amongst more practical riders, but some bike nerds still find them useful.\\nJumping\\nJumping a bike is a whole skill in and of itself. Start small and stay within your abilities or you will get hurt! To learn in a controlled environment, I’ve built my own jumps where I can slowly progress in size.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe construction is extremely straightforward, but finding the perfect curve is an art and a science. These are all quite “steep kickers” that send you high and short (not low and long).\\nI’d recommend the “pool noodle” technique for coming up with the desired curve. Rookie move is making the jump too steep!! You want a long ramp (mine are all nearly 4ft in length) with a very gradual curve upwards. Rookies make jumps too steep, so when in doubt go low.\\n\\n\\nThe biggest so far has it’s lip just over 3ft tall, and an 8ft gap from lip to landing.\\nPro tip: design your jump as a triangle to prevent it from tipping during use!\\n\\n\\nOSB (Oriented strand board) is the sidewall material, and much cheaper than plywood.\\n\\n\\n\\nRiding big drops\\nMy technique is to carry enough speed into the drop such that you don’t pull back on the handlebars. Just ride it off smoothly, and keep your weight centered over your wheels. Tires should land simultaneously, or with the front slightly sooner to absorb the impact. \\n\\nThe ~6ft drop on Scorpion trail at Galbraith.

Pretty novel and creative way to summit unclimbable peaks.\\n\\nFirst Ascent: The Blocks in San Rafael Swell, Utah\\nIf you’ve climbed damn near every possible peak in Colorado, what do you do? Turn to first ascents to fill your time. That’s what we did with the help of legendary peak bagger, and close family friend, Dave Goldstein.\\nThe area is filled with Monument Valley-style towers rising out of the desert. Most of the tower is essentially unclimbable with no route up, but of course, there was a natural weakness to be found. Our ascent was primarily a 5.6 or 5.7 hand crack.\\n\\nDave Goldstein leads the pitch. The rock is brittle and he had a few holds break away under pressure.\\nFor the descent, we had little choice but to drill (somewhat suspect) bolts into the sandy rock, hence our triple protection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen drilling bolts, don’t forget your blow tube!\\nUnbeatable view from up there. Check out this 360 Photo-Sphere from the summit!\\n\\nMy dad, Randy, rushing to be the first to the top (since the true summit is the top right).\\n\\nIf you ever make it up there, be sure to leave your name in the summit register 😉 \\n\\nWe stashed gear for some sport climbing of this adjacent tower the next day!\\n\\n\\nThe Classics with a Classic Friend\\nHiking the Enchantments with Terrence was amazing. My parents have climbed almost every peak in that range (Prussik is one of the most scenic!). Following in their footsteps is very fulfilling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrip Report: Boston Peak and Mt. Sahale\\n📍 Cascade Pass, North Cascades\\nThis trip report is intended to assist anyone attempting to summit Boston Peak in the North Cascades. Our route was 5th class, 16 miles, 6k ft elevation gain and took 13 hours to complete. Background info (including several fatalities on Boston) found on Summit Post.\\nThe approach\\nWe entered via the Sahale Mountain trail. Cascade pass and the Sahale Arm are simply gorgeous, and the arm offers a comfortable non-switchback ascent (woo!), while also being a unique geological feature. \\nThe Ascent to Sahale is great fun scrambling, with a snow crossing required (ice axe highly recommended). \\n\\n\\nToday was specific practice on glacier self arrest after a small slip I had recently that made me conscious of glacier training. One of my friends’ friends died in a crevasse this week, he was 25 and a skilled mountaineer. This is real to me. I need to keep training to avoid his same fate, rest in peace good man.\\nCascade Pass’s Topo Aurora was simply gorgeous in the morning. \\nTopo Aurora“The phenomenon of blue haze that results from the mountains sinking into the atmosphere”\\n\\n\\nI’d recommend cascade pass at sunrise. That Topo Aurora phenomenon is amazing! \\nThe traverse from Sahale to Boston is best completed STAYING ON TOP OF THE RIDGE. In particular, make sure to take to top line, and DO NOT traverse around the right side as shown below. This point is a little over halfway along the traverse starting at Sahale towards Boston.\\n\\nView from further away, my back is to the Sahale Summit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Climb\\nThe climb itself is fun, especially through the crack section. There are plenty of holds, but it’s steep and exposed. The rock quality is okay, and quite protectable with cams, Tricams and nuts. However, bring helmets since there’s LOTS of loose rock!\\nNatural Weaknesses: 4 Pitches, a STIFF 5.6, and was very steep at times and during the crack pitch. No existing protection, but there are 3 (or was it just two?) rappel anchors right along this route for the descent. My dad and I named this route Natural Weaknesses because I don’t think it’s an existing route, and we just wanted to mess around and find a fun way up.\\n\\nWe named the route just for fun, hope you enjoy. We didn’t see the purple 4th class route on our way in, we only saw it while returning (of course) so keep an eye out right at the base of the summit.\\n\\nBoston Summit with my dad. I don’t think Boston sees too much traffic, but there was a nice young guy from Oregon up there who took the photo.\\nThanks for reading, and I hope you get out and about in the great outdoors! If you used this guide, send me an email and, if you want, include a photo from your trip at kastanday[_at_]gmail.\\n\\nRussian Butte\\nOk this video is hilarious, and super short. \\n\\n\\n\\nA not often climbed peak, my dad only made it on his 5th attempt. Ropes required for the summit. Read his full trip report here, great info for fellow peakbaggers.\\nIt took us 12.5 hours to make it 9.6 miles, and 4k elevation gain. So it was very slow going through the bushwhacking, so keep that in mind. \\nSee our route below (GPX file in PeakBagger link). We came in from the north, you can also come from the South, but that route faces cliffs near the summit. \\n\\nGPX available on our PeakBagger trip report\\n\\nLove the look of these summit rock formations\\nWe set up 2 rappel stations for the descent. Lucky you if you can find them from these photos!\\n\\nThis is the view looking south. That’s why I’d suggest coming in from the north.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt does require fording across the Snoqualmie river, and hopping across a stream.\\nAlso, it’s a dream of mind to build a mountain bike track straight down this mountain. Just clear up some of the bigger sticks, and you’d have an insanely steep and rowdy descent. Jumping off rock drops, slaying the brown pow loam.. that’s the dream.\\n\\nPerfect location for a straight-down-the-fall-line MTB trail.\\nSurfing 🏄\\u200d♂️\\nGod I wish I knew how to surf. If you can take me surfing frfr send me an email kastanday[_at_]gmail.\\nSailing ⛵\\nGoal: I’m working on a trip down the Pacific coast, from Seattle to the tip of south America… One stage at a time, with help. This can only happen after a vaccine is available.\\n\\nOur new-to-us sailboat in Zezuantenejo, Mexico! Taken right as COVID-19 went worldwide, and I flew home one day before the boarder was partially closed (to non-essential travel).\\nScuba 🤿\\nOn hold until a vaccine is available. Goes hand-in-hand with our sailing trip down the coast of America’s. \\nParagliding 🪂\\nGoals: Just learn to cruise by myself, alone from the first flight if possible.\\n\\nIf you think we’d have fun together, email me!

A destructive personal idea is usually USEFUL somehow, examine what it is enabling – what’s the function/purpose it’s serving? What deeper truth is it helping you avoid? Then, just tell the person what you’ve observed. They can easily comment on that.The role of a therapist is to make thoughtful and true interpretations “to the person about why he doing the things he doing”.If I feel some type of way, it might be that another person needs me to feel that way (in order to protect themselves). Examine how an emotion enables a relationship.\\nTop quotes\\n“How anger can keep us from sadness”\\nAt parenting: Don’t give empty praise, instead being present builds a child’s confidence because it lets the child know that she is worth thinking about.” p.21\\n“The most important thing is that the patient leaves our first meeting feeling heard. What he came to say has 1. been said, 2. listened to, and 3. thought about.” This applies to a couple’s arguments’ too. pg.49\\n“The personal he most avoided was the person upon whom he was the most dependent – the person he most wanted.”\\n“I didn’t want to give her any excuse to tell me off. I was always afraid of being scolded, but so what?”\\nWe can be trapped by our own assumptions: “I felt that people were fundamentally fault-finding. I didn’t know that my idea of a person is of someone who wants to scold me. I just thought that people are that way, but it turns out that I was wrong.”\\n“During our sessions, if she wasn’t attacking herself, she was attacking (her parents). At times she behaved as if she had to kill her parents to become herself.”\\n“On Closure: They suffer more because they’re stuck on the idea of closure; they expect to make progress, to move through certain stages of grief. And when they don’t they feel that they are doing something wrong, or, more precisely, that there is something wrong with them. ‘I should have moved on by now’, etc. There is little room here for emotional exploration or understanding. This way of being leads to self-loathing, despair, depression.”\\nClosure – it doesn’t always happen like that.The 5 stages thing is BS. Enduring sorrow is possible, even if through “the work of mourning, we gradually feel better, though some heartache remains.”Closure as an extraordinarily compelling fantasy of mourning. Delusion of closure: “the false hope that we can deaden our living grief.” p.210An alternative to closure is story: “All sorrows can be borne if you put them into a story or tell a story about them. But what if a person can’t tell a story about his sorrows? What if his story tells him?”Can I tell a feel-good story about why Anne and I broke up? Yes I did this, and that’s the only thing that really helped. Reminding myself why we weren’t a good fit, and I was ready to break up with her anyway.\\nSome fun vocab\\nCaptious – apt to notice and make much of trivial faults.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

None of his critics have done that, and few could.RE: Sources of happiness; Chris was addiment that it came from mmore than just interpersonal, but then when he was in the bush he started writing “Happiness is only true when shared.” That’s a full about face on the merits of sharing the experience.\\nAt first I resented the kid, as an astonishing number of people did, for his apparent HUBRIS. But I slowly realized he was so close to success, with such a razor sharp margin of error, he nearly made it work in astounding fashon. The kid was resourceful, determined, skilled, poetic at times. He cared.\\nThe book was a captivating read, especially once I got to see the mertis of Chris’s preparation instead of resenting his risk taking.\\nPhilosophy: Happiness is best when shared. Chris goes back and forth on this, and it depends on the person, but it carries weight. \\nImpressions\\nI think he went into the Wilderness in part just to spite his parents and his mission was slightly suicidal because he didn’t care if he lived or died and wanted to prove his parents wrong either way. Actually, after finishing the book I think he was not suicidal, and very careful in his preparation, he just had huge ambition and it actually almost worked! He got unlucky eating those potato seeds that literally nobody really knew were poisonous during only a certain window of the growing season. \\nPage 64 talks about how he didn’t get along with his parents and wanted to prove those idiots wrong once and for all. So much of his mission seems driven by platitudes of youth: a desire to prove parents wrong (via risk taking), self-sufficiency and a romanticized notion of the land imprinted upon him by reading Tolstoy.\\nTop quotes\\nChris McCandless (the subject of the book) read a lot of Tolstoy and emulated Tolstoy’s mission of giving up privilege to wander the destitute.\\n“Sometimes he tried too hard to make sense of the world, to figure out why people are bad to each other so often. A couple of times I tried to tell him it was a mistake to get too deep into that kind of stuff, the Alex got stuck on things.” p.19\\n“a world in which he felt grievously cut off from the raw throb of existence. p.22\\nChanged name from Chris McCandless → Alexander Supertramp (ahh the origins of the supertramp name).\\nIt is the experiences, the memories, the great triumphant Joy of living to the fullest extent in which real meaning is found. God it is great to be alive! p.37\\nI’d like to repeat the advice I gave you before in that I think you really should make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may have previously never thought of doing or had been to attempt. p.55\\nBut in reality nothing is more damaging to The Adventurous Spirit within a man than a secure future. p.56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome fun vocab\\nConvivial: friendly, lively, and enjoyable. “a convivial cocktail party”\\nAsceticism: severe self-discipline and avoiding all forms of indulgence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

His horniness seems like a stable of his life, and yet he managed to be quite productive. He was also a good student and hard worker. Follow your curiosity. \\nThis guy is a full human, like me. He spent a lot of time going to bars and chasing after girls, and learning other languages, learned to paint and draw (just to see nude women) and things like that.\\nHe got extremely lucky; first technical presentation was to Einstein and Oppenheimer at Los Alamos.\\nHe went to a titty bar for lunch every day for years as a married professor. And advocated for it to city council when some community people wanted it shut down.\\nHe thought the Nobel prize was more of a nuance than a help (money was nice, except it tempted him).\\nExcept he thought if he had too much money (like from a really good University of Chicago offer) it would RUIN him BECAUSE: he could get a mistress with her own home. He laments that ‘he would worry about her all the time, and it would ruin his marriage, and make him sad.’ He turned down the fuck-you-level “mistress money.” One life lesson is knowing your weakness, and defending against them even when that means turning down a major raise.

How can we make the zero carbon option cheaper?\\nThe whole book is organized around these topics: isolate what produces the most emissions, and go one by one to investigate the green premium of zero-carbon alternatives.\\nImpressions\\nMany challenges in many areas. Impact is now imminent, so maybe we can motivate to solve it: this lifetime, and the next will feel it bad.\\nNumber of days where temps reach 90deg or more will increase from occasional (14 per year) to the new normal (100 days per year).\\nPay heavily to study the root cause, knowing that will guide you to the obvious solution.\\nWho should read it?\\nIt’s a very approachable book, and quick read. Great value per word due to the author’s concision and a focus on data. Critical info to ask the right questions. \\nMost useful to policy makers, including CEOs or executives trying to improve their company’s impact. \\n5 CENTRAL QUESTIONS (to bring to every climate conversation)\\nWhat percent of the 51 billion tons is that?Put changes in context of the whole.500 million tons is 1%. That’s a significant milestone for a project.What’s your plan for cement?Steel + cement = 10% of all emissions (5 billion tons)5 key activities. Solutions must address all 5.How much power are we talking about?Kilowatt = house. Gigawatt = smaller city. 1000 gigawatt = USA.How much space do you need?Power density ( per square meter)Given some power output, how much space is required for that?What’s the green premium?And is it low enough for middle income countries to pay?\\nTop quotes\\nNo page numbers here, not included in my kindle version.\\nFun facts: batteries are 35x heavier than gas for the same energy.\\nToday solar panels convert 25% of energy into electrons. \\nAlso there’s a mysterious 10% efficiency loss very shortly after manufacturing panels. They work better for the first few hours/days, then get 10% worse. But that’s another story, told by Real Engineering below.\\n(18) The Mystery Flaw of Solar Panels – YouTube\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrent US policy will nudge us down 5% in co2 emissions by 2030, which ain’t nothing, but not much either.\\nParis is relevant primarily as proof of international cooperation. (and get 3-6 billion tons lower by 2030). 6 billion would be 12% of global emissions, not bad.\\nGlobally, building a new New York City every MONTH.\\nUsing current Direct Air Capture (DAC) of carbon, you could solve the climate problem for minimum $5.1 trillion per year, ever year, indefinetly while we’re producing emissions. That’s 6% global economy. That’s probably the most expensive way of solving anything, which gives me hope.\\nI didn’t realize: When you cover land with water (like intentional flooding created by a new dam), if there’s a lot of carbon in the soil, it will escape through the water and form METHANE!! Makes (some) dams much worse for the atmosphere. “depending on where it’s built, a dam can actually be a worse emitter than COAL for 50 to 100 YEARS before it makes up for all the methane it’s responsible for.”\\nStanding water releases carbon from soil as METHANE!Methane is… ~thousands of times worse than CO2 (as a greenhouse).\\nElectrifying the grid is the most important part, solar + wind + nuclear must be the answer.\\nGate’s Terrapower likes a “travelling wave reactor” design.\\nIt’s amazingly cheap to TOTALLY green-ify the US electric grid, BUT ONLY IF WE NATIONALLY UNIFY IT. Piecemeil implementations could be much, much more expensive.\\nOther countries would be much more expensive to go zero-carbon grid.Need national to make it easy to share electricity LONG DISTANCES; need more, new, high voltage, long distance lines.Because distribution is responsible for more than 1/3 of energy cost.⭐ Green premium of America’s entire electricity system: only 15% increase in price. That’s about %18 per month for average home.BUT: need to triple our annual increase in energy capacity in the grid, from 22 gigawatts a year to 75 gigawatts a year of NEW GREEN ENERGY PRODUCTION.\\nR&D is severely underinvested. Just 0.3% of energy company revenue goes into R&D. Tech is 10%, pharma is 13% spend on R&D.\\nPolicy Principles that are Timeless:\\nTechnology neutral (don’t pick winners and losers, create incentives for the end result desired: reduced emissions).Predictable (not regularly expiring and getting extended, as happens now, creating uncertainty)Flexible (so anyone can take advantage, “not just those with large federal tax bills)\\nThe impressive power of Mangrove forests. Mangroves = short tress grow along coastline, adapted to salt water.\\nExcellent cheap, effective breakwaters: prevent storm flooding, protect fish habitats.All told, they do a great job already: saving some $80 billion a year in losses.\\nLet’s talk concrete\\nI’ve long been obsessed with concrete: it’s so essential to modern life, but it’s so harmful to create.\\nPer year (just in US), 600lbs of cement (not concrete) are made for every person. And 600 lbs of steel (iron + carbon).\\nMaking concrete makes CO2 in the exact same quantities; it’s 1:1. For every bit of concrete we make, we make the same amount of CO2 via a chemical reaction between limestone and CO2. (Also technically I’m talking about cement here, a precursor of concrete, that is then combined with sand, gravel and water).\\nCement relies on calcium, to get calcium we burn limestone (calcium + oxygen + hydrogen).\\nSteel, just as common as concrete, is even worse. It’s 1 : 1.8. For ever bit of steal we make, we also make 1.8 bits of CO2.\\nCement and steel production make up 10% of total emissions, this cleaner production methods are necessary. Cement is hard to improve on due to the simple chemical reaction that’s impossible to work around (so we just do capture). Steel can be green, Gates’ has a company in that space.\\nFacts and Figures\\nMore available land is required for renewables:\\nFigures showing the land area required for renewable energy versus fossil fuels. \\nA graph depicting global energy production sources where coal is dominant. \\nPutting energy consumption in perspective. Finally, US house = 1 kilowatt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

Greenshot is my preference for easy, fast screenshots. \\nFile preview: Quicklook (Windows store)\\n\\nBeautiful and instanious preview like MacOS — just press space with any file selected. \\nClipboard history: Ditto\\n\\nPress ctrl + ` to review everything you’ve copied — makes copying several things very simple. Also works for screenshots captured with Greenshot. \\nWindots + v — windows created a built in clipboard history that’s good enough for most users. Ditto is still better, more powerful.  \\nAltDrag (AutoHotKey) – easily drag and resize windows\\nDownload my excellent AltDrag script here. Then set it to start with windows (shown below in this guide). \\nJust hold alt, and drag windows anywhere without having to try and click the small title bar. Alt + right click drag to easy resize the windows without clicking the small resize target in the corner. Here’s a demo.\\n\\n\\nA simple demo of what alt drag enables. It’s better than it looks, and changed the way I use my computer to be more productive. \\nHighly recommended, my usage tips:  This is remarkably useful for brain-computer harmony. This tool stopped my full-screen obsession, instead now I can see several windows at once and more easily resize and move them around at the speed of thought. \\nRequires: AutoHotKey, and my script and manually enable start on windows startup.\\nHere’s my AutoHotKey script. Just load this into a AutoHotKey file, turn it into an executable (.exe), and set it to start on windows startup (copy a shortcut to that .exe into the startup folder). \\nFast, universal file search: Everything search\\n\\nWindows search is notoriously slow, and often doesn’t find what I’m looking for. This makes me often dig through folders instead of searching. \\nEverything search finds any file, instantly. 5 out of 5 stars, perfect utility.\\nClear up storage space: WizTree\\nInsanely useful graphics for clearing up massive amounts of disk space.\\nSeriously good for clearing up space. The graphical view makes it easy to discover hidden files, like cache and /AppData/. I just went from 5gb free, to 51gb free, on a whim!\\nYouTube DLG\\nDownload YouTube videos quickly, with no quality limit. \\nStartup programs made easy\\nTo set ANY program to start on Windows’ boot, copy (a shortcut to) any program into your startup folder: \\nC:\\\\Users\\\\{YOUR_USERNAME}\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Start Menu\\\\Programs\\\\Startup\\nMy startup programs\\nI recommend you disable all non-essential startup programs from the task bar.

Manage, and save Chrome tabs between computer restarts. Raindrop – Best “favorites” app. Beautiful, free and cross platform (and cross browser to prevent lock in). Google search shortcuts – easily open google search results, or revise your history. Dark Reader – Dark mode for all websites. It really works on 98% of websites. Night Eye — the PREMIUM dark-mode for websites extension. It works way better than the free Dark Reader extension. I finally paid $9/yr for it and I wish I did it sooner.

But eventually, his message spoke to me, and I’m shockingly touched by his message: you have to decide to live a meaningful and happy life, and here are some tools for finding it.\\nIt’s the perfect message for my stage in life. I come from modest privledge, but feel burdened by the guilt and piggon-holed to a tedius (and meaningless?) IT career. His perspective explained my guilty, mixed emotions, and helped articulate a framework for building a meaningful life for myself. I’m shocked I connected with this book as I did.\\nLike the resource course from Rachael Maddow’s excellent book Blowout — the Privilege Curse plagues rich kids (psychological problems 3x the national average). “Silver dagger in the back syndrome.” Gift guilt == felling forever unworthy. That’s how I feel living at home after graduating college during a pandemic and being unable to find a job. “Privilege guilt is a simmering malaise that can suck the joy out of privileged lives” (41).\\n“The aim was not to fit in with life, but to find the life that was the right fit for each of us.” 108. This is what privledge should afford, but often does the opposite for a crushing fear of being left behind.\\nPrivlidge strips choice and time, not adding to it. Use your privledge to buy youself time to find the righ vocation — that happens via doing, trying, and retrying. Listening to yourself, and thus investing in self-knowledge.\\nFinding your vocation\\nFind a “vocation” (his version of a true calling) that’s your “own unique mix of talents, inclinations, and passions” (197). I like this framing, these are categories I can work with, that I can write down.\\nPeter echos [[The Practicing Mind]]. Don’t honor the payoff, focus on the practice and achieving excellence in study itself. Study your material like a budist monk studies scripture. ==Observing his father Warren, he observes that process = passion, focus, seriousness of purpose with which the work is approached.== “Work should be demanding and intense, and that should make us happy” (22). Self-respect can only come from earning your own reward” (33).\\nSo, center your life on a practice you enjoy. “Find your calling” went to far to individual indulgence in the 60s, but has swung too far towards money and power more recently. When choosing a vocation or life path, gut check: are you “making that choice out of true conviction, or because it’s where our [inhereted] advantages lie” (56) — are you doing what you love, or just what you’ve inherited. What are your convictions about a well lived life? “True success is something we earn privately and whose value we determine for ourselves” (183). I need to practice revising what I define as successful.\\nFind your vocation, then.. commit! Commitment brings untold rewards (247)z. This reminds me of [[68 pieces of unsoliceted life advice]] and opposite of ‘everyone is against me’ sydrome: the world rewards committed, interesting endeavours. There’s magic in commitment.\\n“There’s a subtle distinction, I believe, between being capable of doing something and being truly prepared to do it” (171).\\nDon’t abdicate what it means to be a professional in order to be a nice guy. Peter was more “intent on avoiding confict than in making the most of my work” (172).\\nWonderful quotes:\\nTaylor Mali, “a poet and teacher who has taken it as his mission to enlarge upon the dignity of teaching” (195-6)“You want to know what I make?I make my kids work harder than they ever thought they could…I make parents see their children for who they are and what they can be…I make kids wonder,I make them question.I make them criticize.I make them apologize and mean it.I make them write, write, write.And then I make them read.You want to know what I make?I make a goddamn difference!

As someone leaving college in my early twenties, there’s a fine line between ‘having fun’ and it becoming a problem.\\nThe best part of this book is learning about Duncan Trussell, and then I was pleasantly struck with the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (that observation bias remembering thing) when I saw his new show appear on Netflix a few days later: The Midnight Gospel. That show is wild and fascinating, surpassing this more conservative book.\\nNotable quotes:\\nDeclining a handjob… The height of christian camp cool.He thought he could pause his maturation in life once he got married.. he later realized “no wonder my wife left me.. I was a sulking man-child.”Mushrooms at a music festival opened his eyes to god, but left no lasting answers. That seems like a common experience. Duncan Trussell goes much further than that, but to what avail??\\nLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

Thank you for helping me arrive more curious then when I left.\\nI’m finishing this book after starting and stopping a handful of times since first seeing it in high school.\\n\\nIt’s a beautiful tale that alternates between the perspectives of a german boy and a french gril. The boy gets sucked into the military (and gets good with radios / electronics). The girl’s dad is a locksmith at a french museum, and she ends up taking care of a huge diamond called the Sea of Flames, the stuff of legends. The girl is blind, apparently giving meaning to the title.\\nIt haunts me how little there is to say of a man’s death.\\nHow do you live with loss, or trauma. How do those memories dance uncontrollably in your head.\\nBeautifully full circle. What answers did she hope to find?\\nNotable quotes\\n“A scientists work, cadet, is determined by two things. His interests and the interests of his time. Do you understand?” “I think so.” “We live in exceptional times, cadet.” (154)“Berlin! The very name like two sharp bells of glory. Capital of science, seat of the fuhrer, nursery to Einstein, Staudinger, Bayer. Somewhere in theses streets, plastic was invented, X-rays were discovered, continental drift was identified. What marvels does science cultivate here now? Superman soldiers, Dr. Hauptmann says, and weather-making machines, and missiles that can be steered by men a thousand miles away.” (218)I imagine this is what it’s like to work at Facebook:“Werner is succeeding. He is being loyal. He is being what everybody agrees is good. And yet every time he wakes and buttons his tunic, he feels he is betraying something.” (250)Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever. (264)For Werner, doubts turn up regularly. Racial purity, political purity–Bastian speaks to a horror of any sort of corruption, and yet, Werner wonders in the dead of night, isn’t life a kind of corruption? A child is born, and the world sets in upon it. Taking things from it, stuffing things into it. Each bite of food, each particle of light entering the eye–the body can never be pure. But this is what the commandant insists upon, why the Reich measures the noses, clocks their hair color. The entropy of a closed system never decreases. (276)Her glasses are gone, and her pupils look like they are full of milk, but strangely they do not unnerve him. He remembers a phrase of Frau Elena’s: belle laide. Beautiful ugly. (469)He thinks of the old broken miners he’d seen in Zollverein, sitting in chairs or on crates, not moving for hours, waiting to die. To men like that, time was a surfeit, a barrel they watched slowly drain. When really, he thinks, it’s a glowing puddle you carry in your hands; you should spend all your energy protecting it. Fighting for it. Working so hard not to spill on single drop. (476)Volkheimer paces in the harsh dazzle of the billboard lights and feels his loneliness on him like a disease. (498)\\nI think about the idea that I will never know hunger. Hunger is described a lot in this book, here are a few I liked:\\n“You will never know hunger”The unsteady feeling in her legs, she knows, stems from hunger. (212)For these past days–how many?–it has felt as thought the hunger were a hand inside him, thrusting around the cavity of his chest, reaching up to his shoulder blades, then down into his pelvis. Scraping at his bones. Today, though–or is it tonight?–the hunger peters out like a flame for which no fuel remains. Emptiness and fullness, in the end, somehow the same. (449).\\nSo many times Marie Laure, the blind girl, is starving while holding a can of food in her hands. She imagines drinking it into her mouth, peach juice delighting her taste, but she can’t open it because enemies are all about and they need to stay silent and hidden.\\nIt’s a beautiful book that’s worth of your time all the way through. \\nLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

It is worse than reading it, but better than nothing during road trips and workouts.\\nI started writing these reviews so I better remember what I read. These are summary notes of surprising information.\\nEnergy incredibly put me into the minds of those who invented our greatest leaps forwards in energy production. I could imagine how, and why first inventors stumbled across their creations, like those first tools to harness steam power. Steam, incidentally, was my favorite energy form described. Initially very crude with building-sized machines to produce only a few horsepower, steam’s successive improvements changed the world and beautifully mirrors the evolution of computers. I applaud and recommend Energy for leaving me with a comprehensive understanding of how humans modernized.\\nIn early mines of gold and later coal, methane would build up overnight seeping out of the rock. To eliminate it in the morning, a candle on a long stick would be brandished by a man crawling down the floor of the cave. It would trigger explosions that (should) go over the prone man’s head. Not infrequently, men were shot like cannon balls out of the tunnels. It was particularly bad after long holidays, the irony. Also, mine drainage, the first use of steam power, was “the great engineering challenge of the age.” It’s pumps man, funny that it was such a challenge. \\nMy favorite bookmarks!\\nThe development of fertilizer that was cheaper to transport and more effective than horse manure turned the shit filling cities from a profitable byproduct (street cleaners were very profitable, ushering a beautiful circle of life back to farms) into an expensive nuisance. Wow.Energy source adoption follows a remarkably similar pattern. It takes 40-50 years to go from 1% market share to 10% market share, and of those that make it further, it takes another 100 years to get to 50% market share. Society adopts a new mainstream energy source roughly every 100 years. US energy 70% wood in 1870, and 70% coal in 1900. That’s a big shift. Kerosene was also cheap and abundant. Average people were savvy about which type of coal to buy (for home use) the same way I’m savvy about phones or laptops.  Steam is 1000x the volume of water, easily creating high pressure (a “head of steam”).Modern trains’ wheels only make tiny contact with the rails —the head of a dime (!)— which makes them very efficient. But at first people didn’t think trains would have the traction to spin and pull anything. So interesting (my built up intuition finds this so strange today). The first steam engine was so heavy it broke the tracks constantly, because they concentrated huge weight on only 4 wheels for more traction.There are always doubters. Things take time to catch on. Science is the best tool we have for reliably learning from our mistakes.\\nLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

Our project placed in the top 10 (more specific rankings were not disclosed) and won awards for best use of data and best use of machine learning for the common good. Our program is not currently hosted publicly as our backend services carry hefty fees but we hope to change that by working on student pricing with those companies.\\nMotivation\\nOur goal was to attempt to tackle the growing issue of fake news, which has been exacerbated by the wide-spread use of social media. For example, many believe fake news on social media to be a large contributing factor to results of the controversial 2016 US election. We wanted to create an easy-to-use system to detect the credibility of a user’s claim or article.\\nOverview\\nThere are many ways one could attempt to detect fake or biased news on the internet. However, we feel our implementation based on stance detection offers the greatest flexability and are reliability without having to get into the weeds of labeling individual claims as true or false. Rather we aim for a more general approach classifiing articles from unknown sources as generally agreeing or generally disagreeing with sources of known (high and low) credability.\\nMoreover, our implementation is particularly compelling because we can accept user input as either a link to an article OR as any arbitrary claim to be fact checked like (Obama is not a US citizen). In this way our program acts as a fact-finding search engine and returns links to relevant articles along with that article’s stance (agree/disagree/is-neutral) on that topic! Our program offers tremendous research and discovery potential to users as well as simply checking claims.\\nWe wanted to create an easy-to-use system to detect the credibility of a user’s claim or article, based on the concept of stance detection. Fake news is tough to identify. Many ‘facts’ are highly complex and difficult to check, or exist on a ‘continuum of truth’ or are compound sentences with fact and fiction overlapping. The best way to attack this problem is not through fact checking, but by comparing how reputable sources feel about a claim.\\nProgram pipeline\\n\\nUsers input a claim like “Obama is not a US citizen”\\nOur program will search Event Registry’s database for thousands of articles related to the keywords.\\nWe run those articles through our home-grown stance detection machine learning model which will determine each article’s relevance to the claim and it’s stance on it. We determine if an article agrees/disagrees/is-neutral or is unrelated to the input claim.\\nWe then access our ever-evolving database of source reputability. If lots of reputable sources all agree with your claim, then it’s probably true!\\nThen we cite our sources so our users can click through and read more about that topic!\\n\\nParsing input and fetching articles\\nGiven a user URL or claim, we used Microsoft’s Azure Cognitive and IBM’s Natural Language Processing to parse the article or claim and perform keyword extraction. We then used combinations of the keywords to collect up to a few thousand articles from Event Registry’s database to pass on to the machine learning model. Here we aired on the side of collecting more rather than fewer articles because the machine learning will accurately determine relevancy further in the pipeline.\\nAfter combing through numerous newspaper and natural language processing APIs, we discovered that the best way to find related articles is by searching for keywords. The challenge was implementing a natural language processing algorithm that extracted the most relevant keywords that were searchable, and to extract just the right number of keywords. Many algorithms were simply summarizers, and would return well over 50 keywords, which would be too many to search with. On top of that, many algorithms were resource exhaustive and would sometimes take up to a minute to parse a given text.\\nIn the end, we implemented both Microsoft’s Azure and IBM’s Watson to process, parse, and extract keywords given the URL to a news article or a claim. We passed the extracted keywords to Event Registry’s incredible database of almost 200 million articles to find as many related articles as possible.\\nWith more time, we would love to implement Event Registry’s data visualization capabilities which include generating tag clouds and graphs showing top news publishers given a topic.\\n–Spearheaded by Henry Han\\nMachine Learning for Stance Detection\\nWatch a detailed rundown on our machine learning pipeline from this video we created (~4 min) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0n-0-3XhWc.\\nWe created and implemented a machine learning model in Tensorflow that’s based off of several research papers in the field of stance detection[1][2][3]. Our model uses a combination of Bag-of-Words, Google’s word-2-vec, TF, TF-IDF (Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency), and ‘stopwords’ inside Scikit-learn to vectorize our input. That is run through a single hidden layer with ReLU activation, a fully connected layer and a softmax activation function to produce one of 4 outputs. We are comparing an arbitrary body of text to an arbitrary claim. So our ML outputs whether or not our body of text is ‘related’ or ‘unrelated’ to the claim. If it’s related, then it outputs if the body ‘agrees’, ‘disagrees’ or ‘is neutral towards’ our claim. Our model achieved 82% accuracy on our test data (for pure stance detection.. not necessarily ‘fake news’ detection) [4].\\nOne challenge we faced was the relatively long running time of our program.\\xa0 Focusing in on the machine learning, initializing our model took roughly 10 seconds on a recent laptop.\\xa0 To help mitigate wait time, we began loading our model as soon as a visitor entered the site. Therefore, it was usually available before the user even submitted a search request.\\xa0 Once the articles were retrieved, the model only took about 5 seconds to compare our typical thousands of articles to the user’s claim before returning the results.\\xa0 These results, how the user’s claim compared (agree/disagree) to our reference articles were then passed into our source reputability engine to compute a final score: fake news or not.\\xa0 All subsequent searches from the same user would be conducted on the same session of that model, so no further computation or wait time is required.\\n–Spearheaded by Kastan Day\\nOther (worse) methods of Fake News Detection\\n1. ‘Fake News Style’ Detection\\nSome teams try to train machine learning models on sets of ‘fake’ articles and sets of ‘real’ articles. This method is terrible because fake news can appear in well written articles and vice versa! Style is not equal to content and we care about finding true content.\\n2. Fact checking\\nSome teams try to granularly check the truth of each fact in an article. This is interesting, and may ultimately be a part of some future fake news detection system, but today this method is not feasible. The truth of facts exists on a continuum and relies heavily on the nuance of individual words and their connotations. The nuances of human language are difficult to parse into true/false dichotomies.\\nHuman language is nuanced. Determining a single statement as true or false\\nNo databases of what’s true or false\\nMany facts in a single article existing on all sides of the truth spectrum — is that article true or false?\\nPaperspace’s GPUs\\nWe chose to use papersapce to train and run our machine learning model primarially because of how quick and easy it was to get a paperspace machine up and running for machine learning. This project was completed for HackMIT under a 24 hour deadline. Therefore, speed was of the essence and the MLL-in-a-box preset saved us a significant amount of time while trying to get our TensorFlow moel up and running.\\nI love Paperspace because it is:\\n\\nFast to setup\\n\\nML in a box elimates the nightmare that setting up CUDA can become.\\nGraphical mode is very useful when first setting up a computer\\n\\n\\nEasy to use\\n\\nWith Windows app terminals are dead simple to access\\n\\n\\nPlentiful V-RAM for a bargain\\n\\nOur model required roughly 12 GB of V-RAM which made simply the quantity of V-RAM required our biggest limiting factor when choosing a GPU.\\nAs of posting this article they’re way cheaper than the competition (AWS, Azure) for more V-ram and faster cards.\\n\\n\\n\\nSource Reputability Database\\nIn order for our application to work, we needed to be able to compare new stances to our ever-improving database of source reputability. We wrote a python script to keep track of all encountered sources along with a reputation score of calculated weight. As a start, we hard-coded reputations based off of nationwide research studies, and then every time we ran our algorithm we added any new encountered sources to our database. In order to do this, we calculated a reputation score for each new article by comparing its stance towards the input claim with the stances of sources with known reputation and averaging the result. In the future we hope to incorporate more accurate data-science technique’s to improve our database. As a smaller project, we also hope to figure out a more streamlined approach than keeping track of the database with csv’s by having a copy of the database exist outside of a single run of the application.\\n–Spearheaded by Josh Frier\\nWeb App Architecture\\nWe used ReactJS for our front end and a Flask dev server as our backend. The Flask server starts our scraping & machine learning prediction script with the parameters of the user’s URL or claim when it receives a POST request at an specific endpoint. Our dependencies include two open-source libraries: Semantic-Ui-React and SweetAlerts. We used Facebook’s “Create-React-App” tool to create our web application’s structure.\\n–Spearheaded by Jason Jin\\nTeam Members\\nWe’re all currently sophmores at Swarthmore College.\\n\\nKastan Day\\nJosh Frier\\nHenry Han\\nJason Jin\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] The University of College London’s short paper on the topic:\\n@article{riedel2017fnc,\\n    author = {Benjamin Riedel and Isabelle Augenstein and George Spithourakis and Sebastian Riedel},\\n    title = {A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for the {F}ake {N}ews {C}hallenge stance detection task},\\n    journal = {CoRR},\\n    volume = {abs/1707.03264},\\n    year = {2017},\\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03264}\\n}\\n\\n[2] Cisco-Talos’ work on the Fake News Challenge\\nhttps://github.com/Cisco-Talos/fnc-1\\n[3] The Athene Team for the Fake News Challenge.\\nTheir Github repo\\nTheir Blog Post\\nTheir technical paper\\n[4] Our training data came from the FakeNewsChallenge.org where in 2016 teams competed to develop stance detection models, and only stance detection models, which we built upon in order to do fake news detection.\\nShare this:TweetPocketEmailLike this:Like Loading... \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a website or blog at WordPress.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow\\n\\n\\nFollowing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKastan Day\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign me up\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlready have a WordPress.com account?

                        "-----------------------------------------------------              Research Milestones | About | University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign                                        Research Milestones World-changing achievements, discoveries, and creations are realized at Illinois. Below are several examples of the historical accomplishments of our university. Learn more about these, and others, by visiting the Historical Markers found across the campus.             Disability Resources and Education Founded in 1948 by Dr. Tim Nugent, the Division of Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) was the first post secondary disability support service program in the world. DRES began as a result of Dr. Nugent’s unyielding belief that veterans injured in WWII should nevertheless be able to take advantage of the GI bill and attend college. From those early days came more than 60 years of breakthroughs and “firsts” in accessibility that include everything from wheelchair athletics to buses with wheelchair lifts to curb cuts in our streets and sidewalks.    The Father of Physical Fitness In 1944, Thomas K. Cureton became the director of the physical fitness research laboratory, one of the first of its kind in the nation. He developed methods to test motor and cardiovascular fitness and aquatic performance and to appraise the human physique. Cureton played a major role in the development of the fitness movement in America.    Modern Pork Industry In 1950, Gene Becker accepted a position on the Illinois faculty and began research on the diet for swine.  His findings were revolutionary and put him at odds with the established swine industry.  Becker concluded that adding animal protein and so-called “unidentified growth factors” to feed was unnecessary. In fact, he said, there was “no such thing as unidentified growth factors.” Soon Becker's economical corn-soybean meal diet for swine, which combined corn, soybean-meal, vitamins and minerals, was adopted worldwide.     PLATO In 1960, electrical engineering professor Donald Bitzer and physics professor Chalmers Sherwin developed PLATO, the Programmed Logic Automated Teaching Operation. PLATO was the world’s first shared computer-based education system. It included direct instruction, research, and global communication in several different languages.  It featured the first on-line community and first e-mail program.  PLATO was stocked with so many innovations it was soon used on five continents and at institutions across the U-S.    Special Education In the late 1950s, Samuel A. Kirk established the Institute for Research on Exceptional Children, the first multi-disciplinary research unit of its kind in the world. Kirk’s research and his development of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities led to the concept of “learning disabilities” and to new techniques of remedial education. Thanks to the early work of Kirk and his colleagues – special education was born and huge steps were taken in ensuring that everyone should have the chance to learn.    LED Nick Holonyak was the first graduate student under the guidance of two-time Nobel Prize winner John Bardeen, and joined the Illinois faculty in 1963. Holonyak's accomplishments have changed the world. He introduced the quantum-well laser and invented the first practical light-emitting-diode.  Today, all L-E-Ds and lasers use Holonyak’s quantum well lasers. Holonyak is one of a handful of people who have won both the National Medal of Science and the National Medal of Technology.    Third Main Branch of the ‘Tree of Life’ In 1977, Carl Woese revolutionized molecular biology when he announced that life came in three forms, not two.  Previously, it was thought that the “tree of life” consisted of two main branches – bacteria, and everything else. Woese discovered the third branch, which he named Archaea.  His many awards including the National Medal of Science, the Crafoord Prize in Biosciences given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and a MacArthur Foundation ‘genius’ grant.    First Graphical Web Browser As an Illinois student, Marc Andreessen landed a job as a student-programmer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. There he teamed with staff member Eric Bina, and together they created the prototype for Mosaic, the first browser for the World Wide Web, in 1993. Mosaic was credited with enabling the Web to gain widespread popularity. It was called the first \"killer application.\" Soon after graduating from Illinois, Andreessen met Jim Clark from Silicon Graphics who was interested in starting a new company. Andreessen, Clark, and Bina founded Netscape in 1994. For several years, it was the dominant web browser.    Magnetic Resonance Imaging Paul C. Lauterbur received the 2003 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The prize recognized his development of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which led to the invention of the medical MRI, a device that has become invaluable to the medical field.

Explore Illinois' campus landmarks.             ACES Library, Information and Alumni Center The ACES Library, Information and Alumni Center stands as an informational and architectural landmark on the University of Illinois campus. Dedicated on October 4, 2001, it is a $21 million state-of-the-art facility containing 52,000 net assignable square feet. It integrates traditional information sources with new learning and information technologies. In addition to shelving, seating, reading, circulation, and office space, the library provides enhanced technology areas, an information instruction laboratory, electronic information workstations, and an online search room. The facility also houses four instructional and multimedia laboratories and studios, as well as an Information and Career Services Office and an Alumni Center. Show the ACES library on the campus map    Alice Campbell Alumni Center Alice Campbell Alumni Center is located at Lincoln Avenue and California Street in Urbana, just south of the Hallene Gateway Plaza, the east entryway to the Urbana-  Champaign campus. Named by lead benefactors, Robert C. '54 BUS and Alice Curtis Campbell, JD '43 LAS, of Los Angeles, this facility is a warm and welcoming haven for both U of I alumni and friends on every visit back, be it business or pleasure. Show Alice Campbell Alumni Center on the campus map    Allerton Park and Retreat Center Allerton was deeded to the University of Illinois by Robert Allerton in 1946. Originally called “the farms,” the former private estate includes formal gardens, an extensive landscape park dotted with ornaments and fine art, and a manor house modeled after Ham House in England. Allerton House was built in 1900 and now serves as a conference center. In 1971 the lowland and southern forests of 1,000 acres were declared a National Natural Landmark and in 2007 one of the Seven Wonders of Illinois.    Altgeld Hall Designed by Nathan C. Ricker and James M. White, Altgeld Hall was completed in 1897, with additions in 1914, 1919, 1926, and 1956. When first occupied, it had a museum in the basement, the University Library on the first floor, and stacks and offices on the second floor; it then served as the law building, 1927 to 1955, and the math building and library, 1955 to the present. Named after Illinois Governor John P. Altgeld, the building is considered one of the finest examples of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture in Illinois. The central room is decorated with murals by Newton A. Wells. Show Altgeld Hall on the campus map    Alma Mater Now positioned at the west gateway to the University on Green and Wright Streets, stood until 1962 behind Foellinger Auditorium on the south campus—where romantically inclined students were wont to keep the throne “shiny and well used.” Designed by University graduate Lorado Taft, the statue was unveiled on June 12, 1929. The Alma Mater is shown “as a benign and majestic woman in scholastic robes, who rises from her throne and advances a step with outstretched arms, a gesture of generously greeting her children” (Taft). Learning and Labor flank the main figure. An inscription reads: To thy happy children of the future those of the past send greetings.    Armory The Armory was designed as a military drill hall, an athletic facility, and an assembly hall. More than 2,000 soldiers used the Armory as a dormitory during World War I. Constructed in 1912-14 and modified in 1925-27 and 1962, the building is something of an engineering feat: the long span structure was unique in its day. An example of Georgian Revival architecture, the Armory is an anchor point for the south campus. Show the Armory on the campus map    Astronomical Observatory The Astronomical Observatory was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990, primarily for the advances in astronomy associated with the structure. Under the direction of Professor Joel Stebbins from 1907 to 1922, the observatory was the site for developing the selenium cell and the photoelectric cell, which revolutionized the science of photoelectric photometry—the technique used to measure celestial magnitudes. Revolving around a circular track, the dome rides on 10 wheels and was originally cranked by hand. Much of the original equipment is intact, and the 12-inch refracting telescope is still used for classes. The building was constructed in 1896 at a cost of $15,000; the architect was Charles A. Gunn. Show the Astronomical Observatory on the campus map    Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology Beckman is the largest research building on campus and anchors the far end of the north campus. It is constructed on the site of the University’s first building, which was demolished in 1881 (also site of the Illinois Field baseball diamond and the University’s first collegiate homecoming in 1910). Designed by Smith, Hinchman & Grylls and completed in 1989, the institute was made possible by a $40 million gift from alumnus Arnold O. Beckman and his wife, Mabel M. Beckman. Their gift was supplemented by $10 million from the State of Illinois. Show Beckman Institute on the campus map    Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology The IGB is a $75 million, 186,000 square-foot state-of-the-art facility dedicated to transformative research in agriculture, human health, the environment, and energy use and production. The institute, established in 2007, was founded on the vision of converging the university’s resources and expertise to address grand challenges facing society. The building design facilitates collaboration between the faculty and students who use the open labs and communal meeting spaces to conduct multi-disciplinary research. In addition the building was constructed in such a way that it will never cast shade over the crops grown in the neighboring Morrow Plots.  Show the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology on the campus map    Engineering Hall This example of Renaissance Revival architecture, was built in 1894. Architect George Bullard, a student of Nathan C. Ricker, won a design competition open only to University graduates. The interior has oak woodwork; the ceiling is paneled in Washington fir. The building underwent an extensive renovation that was completed in 2000. Show Engineering Hall on the campus map    Foellinger Auditorium With its dome, Foellinger recalls Thomas Jefferson’s Rotunda on the University of Virginia campus. The auditorium has a copper roof and cornice. Considered an example of the Beaux Arts Classical style, it was built in 1907 from a design by Clarence Blackall. In 1984, the auditorium was completely renovated with funds provided by alumna Helene Foellinger. Show Foellinger Auditorium on the campus map    Grainger Engineering Library Information Center Named in honor of William Wallace Grainger, this library information center opened in 1994. The history of the site of the Grainger Engineering Library Information Center is intertwined with the history of North Campus, the cradle of the University of Illinois itself. The facility sits on the spot where one of the first buildings on campus, Mechanical Building and Drill Hall, was erected in 1871. The building has 92,000 square feet of assignable space and includes two-story reading rooms, seminar rooms, group and scholar studies, and conference rooms, and houses over 300,000 volumes of engineering materials. Show the Grainger Center on the campus map    Halfway House The trolley stand at the north end of the Quad on South Mathews Avenue was originally located on Green Street. It was situated halfway between Champaign and Urbana and served “University stop” on the horse-drawn street-car that ran east-west. First erected in 1885, the structure was moved from storage to its present site in 1964.    Hallene Gateway The east entry to the campus at Lincoln Avenue and Illinois Street features the stone portal from the entrance to the first University-built classroom building, University Hall. The portal entrance apparently was kept behind the Architecture Building for a number of years and then seemingly disappeared from the campus until it was found at Robert Allerton Park in Monticello in 1994. Alan and Phyllis Welsh Hallene, U of I supporters and alumni, donated the funds to construct the gateway plaza, which was dedicated in 1998. Show the Hallene Gateway on the campus map    Harker Hall Originally the Chemical Laboratory, Harker Hall was until recently the oldest remaining classroom building on the campus. Designed by Nathan C. Ricker (with John M. Van Odsel) and built in 1878, Harker Hall is considered Second Empire in style. It is named for Judge Oliver A. Harker, third dean of the law school (1903 to 1916) and the first University counsel. In 1896 the building was struck by lightning and partly burned. The University of Illinois Foundation moved to Harker Hall after extensive renovations in 1992. Show Harker Hall on the campus map    Illini Union The Union was financed with a $450,000 grant from the Public Works Administration and a $550,000 loan from the University of Illinois Foundation. Its Georgian Revival style was conceived by Ernest L. Stouffer, University architect, and Howard Cheney, consulting architect. The cupola, clock, and bell from University Hall (demolished) are retained in the Union. Much of the original woodwork was carved by John C. Freiburg. The building was constructed in 1939-40; a $6.9 million addition in 1960 dramatically increased its size and usefulness. The Union is considered one of the most significant buildings on campus, because of its location, character, quality, and use. Show the Illini Union on the campus map    Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion Ranked second among public museums in Illinois in size and value of the collection, the main museum opened in 1961, funded largely by a generous contribution from alumnus Herman Krannert and his wife, Ellnora Krannert. The Kinkead Pavilion, designed by architect Lawrence Booth and completed in 1988, greatly expanded the exhibition space. Funds for the addition came principally from the William S. Kinkead Estate and the National Endowment for the Arts. Show the Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion on the campus map    Krannert Center for the Performing Arts One of the preeminent performance facilities in the nation, Krannert is largely the result of an additional contribution from the Krannerts. Completed in 1969, the center covers seven acres and includes four theaters and an outdoor amphitheater. The complex was designed by alumnus and architect Max Abramovitz, who served on the design team for the Lincoln Center in New York City. It is home to more than 350 performances each year. Show the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts on the campus map    Lincoln Hall With its bronze bust in the main entrance foyer, Lincoln Hall honors the Springfield lawyer who went on to become President of the United States. The state legislature appropriated $250,000 in construction funds in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of President Lincoln’s birth. The building was completed in 1911, with an addition in 1929. An example of Renaissance Revival architecture, the building also features strong horizontal banding and extended eaves that suggest the Prairie School. W. C. Zimmerman served as architect. Terra cotta plaques on the east exterior depict scenes from President Lincoln’s life; those on the sides display quotations. Show Lincoln Hall on the campus map    Memorial Stadium The stadium was dedicated on October 18, 1924, with a football game against the University of Michigan that has become legendary. The University’s Harold “Red” Grange scored four touchdowns against Michigan in the first twelve minutes, then ran for a fifth touchdown and threw for a sixth. A mixture of Georgian Revival and Neoclassical architecture, the structure is considered one of the nation’s most distinctive sports stadiums. The second story is a colonnade of paired limestone Roman Doric columns, representing University of Illinois students who perished in World War I. More than 20,000 students, alumni, and friends of the University contributed approximately $1.7 million to fund the construction. Show Memorial Stadium on the campus map    Morrow Plots Between the underground Undergraduate Library and the Institute for Genomic Biology, the Morrow Plots are the country’s oldest experimental agricultural fields in continuous use. Agriculture professor Manley Miles and first agriculture dean George Morrow began laying out the plots in 1876. Miles first divided the fields into ten plots of 1/2 acre each. Morrow later divided the area further into plots of 1/20 acre. Morrow modeled the plots after agriculture techniques he had observed in Great Britain (Rothamsted in particular) and France. The plots were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968. Show the Morrow Plots on the campus map    National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), one of the five original centers in the National Science Foundation's Supercomputer Centers Program, opened its doors in January 1986. Since then, NCSA has contributed significantly to the birth and growth of the worldwide cyberinfrastructure for science and engineering, operating some of the world's most powerful supercomputers and developing the software infrastructure needed to efficiently use these systems. Having moved into it’s own building on the north side of campus in 2005, today the center is recognized as an international leader in deploying robust high-performance computing resources and in working with research communities to develop new computing and software technologies. Show the National Center for Supercomputing Applications on the campus map    Natural History Building Designed by Nathan C. Ricker, the Natural History Building is an example of the High Victorian Gothic style. The original building was completed in 1892, and the departments of botany, zoology, and geology moved in that fall. A lecture hall and museum were added in 1909 and 1910 (W. C. Zimmerman, architect), with another addition in 1923 (J. M. White, architect). The building will undergo a $70 million renovation beginning in 2012. Show the Natural History Building on the campus map    Round Dairy Barns These round barns are the inspiration of Wilbur J. Fraser, the first head of the Department of Dairy Husbandry (1902 to 1913). Fraser was a strong advocate of round barns, which offered the dairy farmer “economy of consideration, low maintenance, and labor efficiency.” He also cited the barns’ better ability to withstand prairie windstorms. Fraser and the University’s demonstration barns were apparently instrumental in popularizing the round barn type found throughout Illinois. The first barn was built in 1907-08; the second and third about 1910. Show the Round Dairy Barns on the campus map    Smith Hall An example of the Beaux Arts Classical style by campus architect James M. White, Smith Hall is considered one of the most handsomely detailed classical buildings on campus. Captain Thomas J. Smith, a member of the Board of Trustees from 1897 to 1903, gave farmland and money totaling approximately $480,500 to finance the construction. The building is named in memory of his wife, Tina Weedon Smith. Details throughout the building, including the ornate Memorial Room on the second floor, feature intricate friezes and door surrounds. Show Smith Hall on the campus map    State Farm Center From a purely structural standpoint, State Farm Center is the University’s most significant and revolutionary building. Designed by alumnus Max Abramovitz, the reinforced concrete structure cost $8.5 million and is one of the world’s largest edge-supported domes, spanning 400 feet in diameter and rising 128 feet above the floor. The building is the site of commencement ceremonies and basketball games and hosts many performances, plays, and concerts. It opened as the Assembly Hall on Honors Day, May 3, 1963. Show State Farm Centerl on the campus map    Spurlock Museum Funded by a gift from William and Clarice Spurlock, the museum opened on September 26, 2002. The new museum is a state-of-the-art facility which houses approximately 45,000 artifacts from diverse cultures and varied historical time periods, augmented by noteworthy selections from the University’s Museum of Natural History and Department of Anthropology. Facilities include five permanent galleries and a temporary gallery, the 220-seat Knight Auditorium, the Rowe Multipurpose Learning Center, and the World Heritage Museum Guild Educational Resource Center. Show the Spurlock Museum on the campus map    Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science The home of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois is the Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science, a state-of-the-art building that opened its doors in 2004. On the north side of campus, home to The Grainger College of Engineering, Siebel Center is an interactive computing habitat, made possible by a gift from alumnus Tom Siebel. Show Thomas Siebel Center on the campus map    University Library This intellectual heart of the campus, is part of the ensemble of fine Georgian Revival buildings designed by Charles Platt that form a strongly unified portion of the south campus. Initial construction was completed in 1926, with many subsequent additions. Decorative elements include 27 art-glass windows by J. Scott Williams of New York, depicting the marks of Renaissance printers, and murals by Barry Faulkner entitled The Four Hemispheres: Polar, Celestial, Eastern, Western. Show the University Library on the campus map    Willard Airport The University's Willard Airport, named after Arthur Cutts Willard who served as University President from 1934 to 1946, has been providing airline service to the campus and east central Illinois since 1945.  Located in Savoy it is one of the largest and finest university owned-and-operated airports in the country.

This is due to the great number of events held by Illinois campus units and in campus facilities, and in hopes of helping users find events in an increasingly crowded list.       All Toolbox calendars created by campus units can be considered for inclusion in one or more of the following campus calendars:  Advising and Placement Cultural and International Exhibits General Events Recreation Speakers Staff Training       Adding Your Events   Units that want to see their events listed on any of the campus calendars or included on the Featured Events Calendar must have those events loaded into a Toolbox calendar. Public Affairs cannot hand-enter events. Units that wish to continue to use an existing, non-Toolbox calendaring system may create a parallel Toolbox calendar where they post events they want to share campus- and community-wide. Non-Toolbox Calendars for key campus units will continue to be linked from the Campus Calendar homepage, but their events cannot be placed on the Featured Events Calendar or on any of the campus amalgamated calendars.       Setting up Toolbox Calendars   Setting up a calendar is simple, requires no technical expertise, and takes only minutes. Web Services will be happy to walk you through the process and regularly offers training workshops. To get started immediately please visit the Toolbox. Most campus units should establish a Toolbox master calendar and one or more Toolbox events calendars.  Master calendars can include (i.e., pull in events from) any number of event calendars, but individual events cannot be added to the master calendar. (For example, many units create a master calendar to include their own events calendar, plus the Campus Holidays Calendar and the Academic Dates Calendar, so they never have to personally enter those events.) Event calendars are where you will enter your events, but these calendars cannot include any other calendars.  Units are strongly encouraged to create several Toolbox event calendars. Units rarely have only one type of event; the same unit that lists a lecture by a well known speaker may also have performance events, or training events. The campus calendars include your events only if they match the campus calendar type. By creating a speakers Event Calendar, performances Event Calendar, etc., those events can all be pulled into a single Master Calendar for the unit (probably including a calendar that features intra-unit or not-open-to-the-public events). Then the appropriate campus calendar can maximize exposure of your events by including the event calendars according to type, and there is no redundancy in entering the events into the calendaring system.        Tips for Maximizing Your Event Visibility    Public Affairs will include your Toolbox calendar in the Campus Calendars based on the preponderance of your events and where a user might intuitively look for your events. Your events are much more likely to be discovered quickly if you create separate calendars for each category of events. (Again, this does not have to represent redundant work on your part, since all of your unit's event calendars are pulled into a master calendar.) Give the most complete information possible when entering new events, including a description. Remember that your events will appear in campuswide lists and need to be unwaveringly identified with your unit. List buildings as well as room numbers, name your unit as the event sponsor, and list contact information. Make the event title a link, either to more information or to your unit's homepage. For events that are not open to the public, check the box that says \"This event can only be viewed in this calendar\" when entering the event. This will keep them from being posted on campuswide calendars. Classes, department meetings, TBA events, and \"invitation only\" events are all examples of events that should not be shared with other calendars. Calendars that repeatedly share events that are not public will be pulled from inclusion in campus calendars. Consider a calendar name change. An a-z listing of all Toolbox calendars is linked from the main Calendar Homepage. Is the title of your calendar the name someone would look for intuitively? Are you listed under the O's for Office of...? Or is your calendar listed under T because its name begins with \"The\"? Neither is good practice.        Featured Events Calendar    A very limited number of items of the broadest general interest can be placed on the Featured Events Calendar on the Calendars Homepage. Suggest events for the Featured Events Calendar to Todd Wilson .Events listed in Toolbox calendars have an event ID number found at the end of the Web address for that item. In suggesting events for the featured events calendar, you should reference theevent ID. Thus, you would suggest eventId=18506 for this item: http://illinois.edu/calendar/list/7&eventId=18506. Featured Events will be open to the public and appeal to the broadest possible audience. The mix of featured events  will reflect the breadth of the types of campus activities and represent as many campus units as possible.        Calendar policies   For questions regarding campus calendar policies, contact Todd Wilson, Coordinator of Special Projects.       Calendar setup   For Calendar setup questions contact Jim Wilson . A calendar for adding events to the Web Services event database can be setup in minutes; no technical experience is necessary.  As free workshops are scheduled they will be posted to the Web Services training calendar. For more information please see: http://illinois.edu/goto/WebWervicesTraining.
