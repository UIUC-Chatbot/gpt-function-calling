We also studied the six phases of the\\ninstruction cycleFETCH, DECODE, ADDRESS EVALUATION, OPERAND\\nFETCH, EXECUTE, and STORE RESULT. We used elements of the LC-3 to\\nillustrate some of the concepts. In fact, we introduced ve opcodes: two operate\\ninstructions (ADD and AND), one data movement instruction (LD), and two con-\\ntrol instructions (BR and TRAP). We are now ready to study the LC-3 in much\\ngreater detail.\\nRecall from Chapter 1 that the ISA is the interface between what the soft-\\nware commands and what the hardware actually carries out. In this chapter, we\\nwill point out most of the important features of the ISA of the LC-3. (A few ele-\\nments we will leave for Chapter 8 and Chapter 9.) You will need these features\\nto write programs in the LC-3s own language, that is, in the LC-3s machine\\nlanguage.\\nA complete description of the ISA of the LC-3 is contained in Appendix A.\\n5.1 The ISA: Overview\\nThe ISA species all the information about the computer that the software has\\nto be aware of. In other words, the ISA species everything in the computer\\nthat is available to a programmer when he/she writes programs in the com-\\nputers own machine language. Most people, however, do not write programs\\nin the computers own machine language, but rather opt for writing programs in\\na high-level language like C++ or Python (or Fortran or COBOL, which have\\nbeen around for more than 50 years). Thus, the ISA also species everything\\nin the computer that is needed by someone (a compiler writer) who wishes to\\ntranslate programs written in a high-level language into the machine language of\\nthe computer.\\nQuestion: What is a LC-3 ISA?\\nRelevant text, if any:', \"Use the following portion of a long document to see if any of the text is relevant to answer the question. \\nReturn any relevant text verbatim.\\nThat's one instruction. So here's another instruction, which is add. So this is the add opcode over here. It also has three fields and then three things that have to be fixed to zero. So there's a destination register. That's where we're going to put our answer, 0 through 7. There's one source register, also 0 through 7. Good. And then there's another source register. So it says take two registers, add them together, put the answer, the sum, into destination register. That's all. What are the zeros for? Ah, so that's a good question. So why not just let those be don't cares? So there was this commercial architecture called the 6502, let those be don't cares. And it turned out that those don't cares produced some bizarre effects when software people used those instructions with different bits, because they just built a finite state machine and they left them as don't cares. And so it did something. And turned out it did something sort of interesting that the software people decided that they really wanted. And so they put those non-existence instructions in their software. And then when the 6502 architects wanted to produce a new generation, they found that in fact people had used bit patterns that didn't exist in the instruction set architecture. So the modern view of that is don't ever make that mistake again. If you ever want to extend your instruction set architecture, it's really useful to have undefined bit patterns. On the other hand, having software that takes advantage of a particular microarchitecture's don't cares mapped into something is not so attractive from a design point of view. So let me stop there and we'll look more at these next week. Have a good weekend.\\nQuestion: What is a LC-3 ISA?\\nRelevant text, if any:\"]",

We also studied the six phases of the\\ninstruction cycleFETCH, DECODE, ADDRESS EVALUATION, OPERAND\\nFETCH, EXECUTE, and STORE RESULT. We used elements of the LC-3 to\\nillustrate some of the concepts. In fact, we introduced ve opcodes: two operate\\ninstructions (ADD and AND), one data movement instruction (LD), and two con-\\ntrol instructions (BR and TRAP). We are now ready to study the LC-3 in much\\ngreater detail.\\nRecall from Chapter 1 that the ISA is the interface between what the soft-\\nware commands and what the hardware actually carries out. In this chapter, we\\nwill point out most of the important features of the ISA of the LC-3. (A few ele-\\nments we will leave for Chapter 8 and Chapter 9.) You will need these features\\nto write programs in the LC-3s own language, that is, in the LC-3s machine\\nlanguage.\\nA complete description of the ISA of the LC-3 is contained in Appendix A.\\n5.1 The ISA: Overview\\nThe ISA species all the information about the computer that the software has\\nto be aware of. In other words, the ISA species everything in the computer\\nthat is available to a programmer when he/she writes programs in the com-\\nputers own machine language. Most people, however, do not write programs\\nin the computers own machine language, but rather opt for writing programs in\\na high-level language like C++ or Python (or Fortran or COBOL, which have\\nbeen around for more than 50 years). Thus, the ISA also species everything\\nin the computer that is needed by someone (a compiler writer) who wishes to\\ntranslate programs written in a high-level language into the machine language of\\nthe computer.\\nQuestion: What is a LC-3 ISA?\\nRelevant text, if any:', \"Use the following portion of a long document to see if any of the text is relevant to answer the question. \\nReturn any relevant text verbatim.\\nThat's one instruction. So here's another instruction, which is add. So this is the add opcode over here. It also has three fields and then three things that have to be fixed to zero. So there's a destination register. That's where we're going to put our answer, 0 through 7. There's one source register, also 0 through 7. Good. And then there's another source register. So it says take two registers, add them together, put the answer, the sum, into destination register. That's all. What are the zeros for? Ah, so that's a good question. So why not just let those be don't cares? So there was this commercial architecture called the 6502, let those be don't cares. And it turned out that those don't cares produced some bizarre effects when software people used those instructions with different bits, because they just built a finite state machine and they left them as don't cares. And so it did something. And turned out it did something sort of interesting that the software people decided that they really wanted. And so they put those non-existence instructions in their software. And then when the 6502 architects wanted to produce a new generation, they found that in fact people had used bit patterns that didn't exist in the instruction set architecture. So the modern view of that is don't ever make that mistake again. If you ever want to extend your instruction set architecture, it's really useful to have undefined bit patterns. On the other hand, having software that takes advantage of a particular microarchitecture's don't cares mapped into something is not so attractive from a design point of view. So let me stop there and we'll look more at these next week. Have a good weekend.\\nQuestion: What is a LC-3 ISA?\\nRelevant text, if any:\"]"

       "  Document(page_content=\"That's one instruction. So here's another instruction, which is add. So this is the add opcode over here. It also has three fields and then three things that have to be fixed to zero. So there's a destination register. That's where we're going to put our answer, 0 through 7. There's one source register, also 0 through 7. Good. And then there's another source register. So it says take two registers, add them together, put the answer, the sum, into destination register. That's all. What are the zeros for? Ah, so that's a good question. So why not just let those be don't cares? So there was this commercial architecture called the 6502, let those be don't cares. And it turned out that those don't cares produced some bizarre effects when software people used those instructions with different bits, because they just built a finite state machine and they left them as don't cares. And so it did something. And turned out it did something sort of interesting that the software people decided that they really wanted. And so they put those non-existence instructions in their software. And then when the 6502 architects wanted to produce a new generation, they found that in fact people had used bit patterns that didn't exist in the instruction set architecture. So the modern view of that is don't ever make that mistake again. If you ever want to extend your instruction set architecture, it's really useful to have undefined bit patterns. On the other hand, having software that takes advantage of a particular microarchitecture's don't cares mapped into something is not so attractive from a design point of view.
